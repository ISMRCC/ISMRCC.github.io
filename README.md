## Research Interests

His research interest lies at the interface of ecology and biogeography,
and involves a wide range of spatial scales from local to global and a
variety of taxa including bryophytes, vascular plants, vertebrates, and
invertebrates. In particular, He is interested in finding out the
relative roles of historical and contemporary factors in determining
global patterns in biodiversity.
